# ðŸ§¾ STEMLink - OOP Session 1 assesment

This project demonstrates a simple **object-oriented payment system** for an e-commerce platform, designed using **inheritance**, **method overriding**, and **polymorphism** in Java.

---

When customers check out, they can choose from multiple payment methods:

- Cash on Delivery  
- Card Payments  
  - Credit Card  
  - Debit Card  
- Bank Transfer  

Instead of duplicating logic for each type, a **shared parent class (`Payment`)** defines common properties and behaviors, while **specialized subclasses** implement their unique functionality.  
This mirrors how real-world payment systems are structured for **maintainability** and **scalability**.
